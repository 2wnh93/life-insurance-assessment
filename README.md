# Risk Assessment for Life Insurance (In Progress)
---

## 1. Preamble



## 2. Objective

The goal of the project is to classify insurance applicants into the 8 different risk classes, based on anonymized features. Such features include family history, employment history, age, height, weight and BMI amongst others (See details of data in the [data source section](#6.-Data-Source)). The classification model will be evaluated based on quadratic weighted kappa. The quadratic weighted kappa measures the agreement between two ratings (ie. the actual vs predicted). The metric ranges from 0 (random agreement between raters) to 1 (complete agreement between raters).
